In Unity, you can detect collisions with specific objects by using the OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision) method and checking the tag of the collided object.

You can assign tags to your game objects in the Unity editor. Then, in your collision detection code, you can check if the collided object has a specific tag and perform different actions based on the tag.

Here's an example:

In this example, different actions are performed when the player collides with the ground, an enemy, or a power-up. The specific actions to be performed will depend on your game's mechanics.

should i make a bin player controller or multiple scripts?

GitHub Copilot
Whether to use a single script or multiple scripts for your player controller depends on the complexity of your game and your personal preference.

Single Script: If your game is relatively simple and your player controller doesn't have too many responsibilities, a single script might be sufficient. This can make it easier to manage the player's state and behavior because everything is in one place.

Multiple Scripts: If your game is more complex, it might be beneficial to split the player controller into multiple scripts. This can make your code more modular, easier to read, and easier to maintain. For example, you could have separate scripts for movement, combat, and interaction with objects.

In your case, considering the complexity of a Metroidvania-style game, it might be beneficial to use multiple scripts. For example, you could have one script for basic movement, one for jumping and wall jumping, and another for combat-related actions like firing. This way, each script has a single responsibility, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

should i use a capuslecollider2d or a boxcollider 2d in this super metroid remake proyect for the player


The choice between a CapsuleCollider2D and a BoxCollider2D for your player character in a Super Metroid remake largely depends on the specific mechanics of your game and how you want collisions to be handled.

BoxCollider2D: This is a simple rectangular collider. It's a good choice if you want simple, predictable collision behavior. For example, if you want the player to stop completely when they hit a wall, a BoxCollider2D might be the best choice.

CapsuleCollider2D: This is a capsule-shaped collider that is rounded at the ends. It's a good choice if you want more complex collision behavior. For example, if you want the player to be able to slide along walls or smoothly roll off of edges, a CapsuleCollider2D might be the best choice.

In the original Super Metroid, Samus can roll into a ball, which would be more accurately represented by a CapsuleCollider2D. However, you could also use a BoxCollider2D for the standing and running states, and switch to a CircleCollider2D for the ball state.

Remember, you can also use multiple colliders on the same object to create more complex shapes. For example, you could use a BoxCollider2D for the body and a CircleCollider2D for the head. This can give you more control over the player's collision behavior.
